## ABOUT
Si Suka stands for Incoming and Outgoing Mail Information System which is the author's practical work report project and at the same time will also become an icon of the practical work report that the author made.

The name Si Suka itself was inspired by the name of an application that is also in the Palembang Class I Radio Frequency Spectrum Monitoring Center, namely Si Maya.
